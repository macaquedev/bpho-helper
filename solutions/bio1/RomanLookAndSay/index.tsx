        Since constraints are small, this is a simple simulation question.

      <STitle>Solution</STitle>
      <SText> 
        We can solve the problem by applying the "Roman look-and-say" description $n$ times, and then outputting the number of $I$s and $V$s in the string after $n$ operations.

      <STitle>Implementation Detail</STitle>
      <SText>
        We can convert an integer number to a Roman numeral string by greedily taking the greatest number of powers of ten in each go. 
        A simple way to do this is to construct an array of {<SCode>ones</SCode>}, {<SCode>tens</SCode>} and {<SCode>hundreds</SCode>}.
      </SText> 
      <SText> 
        To apply Roman look-and-say to a string, we can keep track of the following variables: 
        <SList>
          <SText>
            {<SCode>last</SCode>} (the last character we encountered)
          </SText>
          <SText>
            {<SCode>sz</SCode>} (the number of contiguous {<SCode>last</SCode>}) 
          </SText>
          <SText>
            {<SCode>t</SCode>} (an initially empty string, which will have our new string by the end)
          </SText>
        </SList>
        The intricate implementation details can be found below. Note that we add a garbage character '.' to the end of the string being processed, so that {<SCode>t</SCode>} will contain the remaining unused information of {<SCode>last</SCode>} and {<SCode>sz</SCode>}.
