      <SText>
        Let's first notice the small constraint on $m$. 
        This suggests that it is feasible to simulate all $m$ moves.

      <STitle>Solution</STitle>
      <SText>
        To keep track of the trail, we can use a hashmap, storing the last time a cell was visited.
        Unvisited cells can be stored as $-{brace("\\text{inf}")}$, or some other very large negative number. 
        We can simulate each move by keeping track of the direction and position of the explorer.
        To check if a cell contains a trail, we simply need to compare the current time with the time the trail was last visited.
        Formally, if the current time is $j$, and the last time the cell was visited was $i$, 
        the trail still exists if $j - i \lt t$.
        Now, we can simulate each move as specified by the problem statement, and output the explorer's final position.
